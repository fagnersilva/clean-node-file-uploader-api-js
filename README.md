# Clean Architecture

The Clean Architecture, defined by Robert Cecil (a.k.a. Uncle Bob) at 2012, is an architectural pattern to organize the directories in the project, aiming to build at a more robust, flexible and scalable software project. The main idea is to create a software more tolerable to changes facilitating new feature implementations in the future. To understand how it works we can break apart the architecture in a larger set named 'infrastructure' containing the tecnology used by the project, and a smaller inner set named 'domain', or 'core', that builds the application's business rules.
